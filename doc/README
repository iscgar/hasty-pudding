Hasty Pudding Cipher  --  README file (describes all 4 diskettes)

See the file README2 for more detailed information, compile & test, etc.

----------------------

REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATION


hpc-ansi.c    Reference implementation.  ANSI compliant.

hpc-gcc.c     Gcc version.  Faster, cleaner.

hpc-nist.c    Test file to exercise NIST interface functions.
              Pretruncation filename was hpc-nist-top.c.

hpc.h         Insert file from NIST. (was aes.h)

hpc.hlp       Help file for command line interface.


----------------------

MATHEMATICALLY OPTIMIZED IMPLEMENTATIONS


hpc.jar       The .jar file of the compiled Java.

hpc_algo.jav  The algorithm, set up to interface with the simple NIST API.
              Pretruncation filename was HPC_Algorithm.java.

hpc_prop.jav  Malleable properties.
              Pretruncation filename was HPC_Properties.java.

hpc_stan.jav  A standalone version of the algorithm, providing a command
              line interface.
              Pretruncation filename was HPC_standalone.java.

hpc-ansi.c    Reference implementation.  ANSI compliant.

hpc-gcc.c     Gcc version.  Faster, cleaner.

hpc-nist.c    Test file to exercise NIST interface functions.
              Pretruncation filename was hpc-nist-top.c.

hpc.h         Insert file from NIST. (was aes.h)

The optimized C version is the same as the ordinary version,
compiled with the -DOPT128 flag.

TEST VALUES: KNOWN ANSWER TESTS AND MONTE CARLO TESTS


All of these files are compressed with gzip.  The filenames have been mangled.

cbc_d_mx.gz   NIST required tests
cbc_e_mx.gz
ecb_e_mx.gz
ecb_d_mx.gz
ecb_vktx.gz
ecb_vtxt.gz
              Pretruncation filenames were cbc_d_m.txt, cbc_e_m.txt, ecb_d_m.txt,
              ecb_e_m.txt, ecb_vk.txt, and ecb_vt.txt.

len-scan.gz   Encryption of one block for each blocksize 1 - 1200.
              Pretruncation filename was len-scan-1200.

tr*e.gz       Trace of encryption of one block, for many different block sizes.
              The blocksize is the number in the middle of the filename.

trace-hp.gz   Trace of key setup operation.
              Pretruncation filename was trace-hpcksu.

<to be added>
ecb_tbl.txt   Test values to verify internal program tables.

kxexampl      Explanation and four examples of key expansion.
abc, alpha*   Test files for key expansion.

mct-test      Explanation of Monte Carlo testing of various size blocks.
mct1 - mct18  Results of eightteen Monte Carlo tests.
              mct11 is the torture test.
